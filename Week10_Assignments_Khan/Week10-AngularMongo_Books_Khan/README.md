AngularMongoBootstrapTest
=========================
This is a bare bones project that provides support for:

- Angular
- Jasmine
- Karma

To get started, run **npm install** in the root directory for this
project:

	npm install

Next, start Karma by typing **karma start**:

	karma start

Since this project was pulled from GitHub, it includes a .git folder. You should
consider removing this folder if you do not want to use git, or if this folder
is embedded inside another git repository.

Periodically, you should go to the command line in the root directory
for this folder and run **grunt jshint**.

	grunt jshint
	
You should then examine the **result.xml** file to look for any problems
in your code.
